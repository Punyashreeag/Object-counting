# Object-counting
A simple object counting method where objects are masked out from the background ,seperated and then counting is done.
Count cubes:The cubes are seperated from background by thresholding and are then counted.
Counting tetris blocks:Edge detection is done to spot the blocks and then count it.
count pappad:In this particular case the objects cannot be seperated by thresholding,so brown colour objects are seperated using hsv values.
